                                Our object detection model currently does not discriminate between traffic signs (e.g.
                                stop signs and speed limit signs fell under the same class). I wrote a labeling
                                environment, deployed on a webpage, which iterated though our image data and showed
                                traffic sign labels to a human to sub-classify. Because of our vast quantity of data,
                                I designed for speed and parallelized the work so multiple people could label at once.
                                (The demo to the right is targeting humans in the data just as an example).

                                My second year, our object detection model reliably identified traffic lights, but we
                                needed to know which ones were relivant and the state of those lights. So, I wrote a
                                post classification script using color masking which addressed this problem. 
                                Particularly, since I used color masking and the competition traffic lights had a 
                                yellow background, I had to account and adjust for this. (The demo on the left uses 
                                an off-the-shelf YOLO model, so don't focus on which traffic lights are detected. 
                                Instead, pay attention to whether the detected lights are irrelevant (red) or relevant 
                                (green), and the state of the relevant traffic lights).

                                My first year, we had an unreliable object detection model. Particularly, we had trouble
                                classifying deers and traffic cones. I wrote a post classification script which used a
                                color graph in combination with a KNN to achieve over 90% accuracy while being
                                computationally light.
